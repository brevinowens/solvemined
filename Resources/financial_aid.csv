"Pell grants, other federal grants, federal and other loans were not collected prior to 2007-08."
"This table presents data collected from Title IV institutions in the United States. Prior to 2009-10, the data include only Title IV primarily postsecondary institutions."
"SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), Student Financial Aid 2019-20 provisional data."
Types of aid will not sum to students receiving any financial aid because students with more than one source of financial aid were counted for each type of aid they were awarded but were included only once in the any financial aid count. Any financial aid can include Federal work study and other sources known to the institution.
"Prior to academic year 2010-11, the data represents students receiving aid, rather than students awarded aid. Students awarded aid include those who were awarded aid and accepted while student receiving aid include those who were awarded and disbursed aid"
