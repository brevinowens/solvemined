## Project Proposal:

### Question from the client: "What is the relationship, if any, between the enrollment of students by state and the revenue of public instiutions? Additionally, does financial aid impact enrollment henceforth affecting the revenue of these institutions?" 

### Data source 1:
National Center for Education Statistics
#### Description:
link: [Revenue](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/TrendGenerator/app/build-table/6/13?rid=6&ridv=1%7C2%7C4%7C5%7C6%7C8%7C9%7C10%7C11%7C12%7C13%7C15%7C16%7C17%7C18%7C19%7C20%7C21%7C22%7C23%7C24%7C25%7C26%7C27%7C28%7C29%7C30%7C31%7C32%7C33%7C34%7C35%7C36%7C37%7C38%7C39%7C40%7C41%7C42%7C44%7C45%7C46%7C47%7C48%7C49%7C50%7C51%7C53%7C54%7C55%7C56&cid=25)

This table which we were able to download into a .csv file contains revenue data by state of the institution over the last 15 or so years. The data shows how these colleges were making revenue, for example whether the institution were recieving federal grants, local grants, etc.
